Getting Started with Railway.com Bridge Quiz Implementation

I'd definitely like to see your post with the quiz data first. This will help me understand the format of your data and provide more tailored guidance for the implementation. Seeing the actual data structure will allow me to give you more precise steps for parsing and displaying the quiz.


Once I understand your data format, we can proceed with these initial steps:


Initial Setup Plan
1. **Examine your quiz data format**
- Review the structure of your bridge hands data
- Identify how questions and answers are formatted

2. **Set up a Railway.com account**
- Create an account if you don't have one
- Set up a new project

3. **Create a basic Flask application**
- Set up a minimal API to test connectivity
- Create endpoints for retrieving quiz data

4. **Implement data parsing**
- Create functions to parse your bridge hand format
- Convert text data to structured JSON

5. **Create a simple frontend test**
- Basic HTML/JS to connect to your Railway app
- Test displaying a single bridge hand

6. **WordPress integration**
- Add the necessary code to your child theme
- Create a simple shortcode to embed the quiz


Please share your post content with the quiz data, and we can then proceed with more specific implementation steps based on your actual data structure.
